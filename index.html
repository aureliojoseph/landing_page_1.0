      <section class="bio-info">
        <p>
          Since 2008 I have been working on Business Management, helping people
          and companies with Strategic Planning, Analysis of Scenarios, Decision
          Making, Diagnosis of Organizational, Management and Leadership Skills,
          Development and Application of Processes, Development and Management
          of Teams.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2011, I started a retail franchise Business, where I coordinate
          financial and administrative areas.
        </p>

        <p>
          The programming world started as a curiosity and turned out to be a
          vast and deep universe where I see myself in. Therefore, I began my
          journey on learning the path to become a Frontend Developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          My background as a Consultant and in Management has shown me that a
          solid Strategic Plan inspires a stronger sense of belonging for people
          at organizations, and this is also valid for customers' experience,
          directly reflecting on the performance of the company and the product.
          And that is why I am very interested about users interactions and how
          it affects their experience of products and services.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am currently an Associate Consultant at Miguelina Borges Consultoria
          Empresarial, an Administrative and Financial Manager for Kidstok
          Buriti and Cerrado, and a Frontend Developer apprentice.
